### Summary
*Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*<br><br>Recommendation: Upgrade to v3.0.0 or greater.
### Details
Jquery is a javascript library for DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax.   When text/javascript responses are received from cross-origin ajax requests not containing the option `dataType`, the result is executed in `jQuery.globalEval` potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the origin.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: >=1.4.0 <=1.11.3 || >=1.12.3 <=2.2.4
<br>• Patched Versions: >=3.0.0
