### Summary
*Denial of Service*<br><br>Upgrade to version 6.4.1 or later.
### Details
Nes is a websocket extension library for hapi.   Hapi is a webserver framework.  Versions below and including 6.4.0 have a denial of service vulnerability via an invalid Cookie header.  This is only present when websocket authentication is set to `cookie`.  Submitting an invalid cookie on the websocket upgrade request will cause the node process to error out.
