### Summary
*File Descriptor Leak Can Cause DoS Vulnerability*<br><br>Recommendation: - Please upgrade to version 2.2.x or above as soon as possible.
### Details
Versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x have a file descriptor leak that when triggered repeatedly will cause the server to run out of file descriptors and the node process to die. The effort required to take down a server depends on the process file descriptor limit. No other side effects or exploits have been identified.  ### Impact  This vulnerability allows an attacker to take down a hapi-based server running versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x.  This does NOT affect hapi 1.x deployments.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: 2.0.x || 2.1.x
<br>• Patched Versions: >= 2.2.x
