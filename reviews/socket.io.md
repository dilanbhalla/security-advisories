### Summary
*Insecure randomness*<br><br>Upgrade to v0.9.7 or later.
### Details
Socket.io is a realtime application framework that provides communication via websockets.  Because socket.io depends on `Math.random()` to create socket IDs, the IDs are predictable. An attacker is able to guess the socket ID and gain access to socket.io servers, potentially obtaining sensitive information.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <=0.9.6
