### Summary

### Details
sequalize is an Object-relational mapping, or a middleman to convert things from Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server into usable data for NodeJS  A fix was pushed out that fixed potential SQL injection.  The two fixes were  - [REMOVED/SECURITY] findOne no longer takes a string / integer / binary argument to represent a primaryKey. Use findById instead - [REMOVED/SECURITY] where: "raw query" is no longer legal, you must now explicitly use where: ["raw query", [replacements]]
