### Summary
*Potential Command Injection*<br><br>Recommendation: Upgrade to at least version 1.6.1
### Details
The npm module "shell-quote" cannot correctly escape ">" and "<" operator used for redirection in shell. I'm wondering if this might be possible vulnerability for many application which depends on shell-quote.  For example:     const quote = require('shell-quote').quote;    console.log(quote(['foo>bar']));  will print "foo>bar", where "foo\>bar" is desirable.  This module is downloaded more than 1M times per month and many other modules are depending on this. If an application is escaping command-line args with this module, they might be vulnerable from malicious user input.  For example: ``` var sq = require('../tests/get/shell-quote-1.6.0'); var exec = require('child_process').exec;  var pattern = process.argv[2];  command = sq.quote(['grep', pattern])); exec('cat file | ' + command, function ( err, stdout, stderr) {     console.log(command, stdout);    }); ``` will be vulnerable when user input something like pattern = ':</etc/passwd', which causes the content of /etc/passwd to be leaked.  Internally, (Jon Lamendola, Nick Starke, Jacob Waddell) found that the `;`, `{`, and `}` characters weren't escaped properly either. This allows for full command injection. A malicious user could input `'a;{echo,test,123,234}'` to execute echo fully.
