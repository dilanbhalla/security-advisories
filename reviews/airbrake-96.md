### Summary
*Insecure Default Configuration*<br><br>Recommendation: Change to use https or update to at least version 0.4.0
### Details
The airbrake module defaults to sending environment variables over HTTP. Environment variables can often times contain secret keys and other sensitive values. A malicious user could be on the same network as a regular user and intercept all the secret keys the user is sending. This goes against common best practice, which is to use HTTPS.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <=0.3.8
<br>• Patched Versions: >=0.4.0
### Methodology
