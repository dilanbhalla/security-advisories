### Summary
*Cross-Site Scripting*<br><br>Recommendation: Upgrade to v1.10.3 or greater.
### Details
i18next is a language translation framework.  Because of how the interpolation is implemented, making replacements from the dictionary one at a time, untrusted user input can use the name of one of the dictionary keys to inject script into the browser.  Example:  ``` var init = i18n.init({debug: true}, function(){   var test = i18n.t('__firstName__ __lastName__', {         escapeInterpolation: true,         firstName: '__lastNameHTML__',         lastName: '<script>',   });   console.log(test); }); // equals "<script> &lt;script&gt;" ```
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <=1.10.2
<br>• Patched Versions: >=1.10.3
