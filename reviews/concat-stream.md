### Summary
*Memory Exposure*<br><br>update concat-stream to 1.5.2 or higher
### Details
.write(number) in the affected `concat-stream` versions passes a number to Buffer constructor, appending a chunk of uninitialized memory. Versions <1.3.0 are not affected due to not using unguarded Buffer constructor.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: >=1.3.0 <1.3.2 || >=1.4.0 <1.4.11 || >=1.5.0 <1.5.2
<br>• Patched Versions: >=1.5.2 || >=1.4.11 <1.5.0 || >=1.3.2 <1.4.0
