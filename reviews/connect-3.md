### Summary
*methodOverride Middleware Reflected Cross-Site Scripting*<br><br>Recommendation: Update to the newest version of Connect or disable methodOverride. It is not possible to avoid the vulnerability if you have enabled this middleware in the top of your stack.
### Details
Connect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.  The "methodOverride" middleware allows the http post to override the method of the request with the value of the "_method" post key or with the header "x-http-method-override".  Because the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect answered with a 404 page containing the "Cannot [method] [url]" content. The method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.   ###Example: ``` ~ curl "localhost:3000" -d "_method=<script src=http://nodesecurity.io/xss.js></script>" Cannot <SCRIPT SRC=HTTP://NODESECURITY.IO/XSS.JS></SCRIPT> / ```  ###Credit: [Sergio Arcos](https://twitter.com/martes_trece)  ###History (2013-06-27) Bug reported: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/831  (2013-06-27) First fix: escape req.method output https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/277e5aad6a95d00f55571a9a0e11f2fa190d8135  (2013-06-27) Second fix: whitelist https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/126187c4e12162e231b87350740045e5bb06e93a
