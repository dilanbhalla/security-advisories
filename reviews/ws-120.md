### Summary
*DoS due to excessively large websocket message*<br><br>Recommendation: Update to version 1.1.1 of ws, or if that is not possible, set the `maxpayload` option for the `ws` server - make sure the value is less than 256MB.
### Details
ws is a "simple to use, blazing fast and thoroughly tested websocket client, server and console for node.js, up-to-date against RFC-6455"  By sending an overly long websocket payload to a `ws` server, it is possible to crash the node process.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <=1.1.0
<br>• Patched Versions: >=1.1.1
