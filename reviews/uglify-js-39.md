### Summary
*Incorrect Handling of Non-Boolean Comparisons During Minification*<br><br>Upgrade UglifyJS to version >= 2.4.24.
### Details
[Tom MacWright](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/751) discovered that UglifyJS versions 2.4.23 and earlier are affected by a vulnerability which allows a specially crafted Javascript file to have altered functionality after minification. This bug was [demonstrated](https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/backdooring-js/) by [Yan](https://twitter.com/bcrypt) to allow potentially malicious code to be hidden within secure code, activated by minification.   ### Details:  In Boolean algebra, DeMorgan's laws describe the relationships between conjunctions ( && ), disjunctions ( || ) and negations ( ! ). In Javascript form, they state that:  !(a && b) === (!a) || (!b)  !(a || b) === (!a) && (!b)  The law does not hold true when one of the values is not a boolean however.  Vulnerable versions of UglifyJS do not account for this restriction, and erroneously apply the laws to a statement if it can be reduced in length by it.  Consider this authentication function:  ``` function isTokenValid(user) {     var timeLeft =         !!config && // config object exists         !!user.token && // user object has a token         !user.token.invalidated && // token is not explicitly invalidated         !config.uninitialized && // config is initialized         !config.ignoreTimestamps && // don't ignore timestamps         getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry); // > 0 if expiration is in the future      // The token must not be expired     return timeLeft > 0; }  function getTimeLeft(expiry) {   return expiry - getSystemTime(); } ``` When minified with a vulnerable version of UglifyJS, it will produce the following insecure output, where a token will never expire:  ( Formatted for readability )  ``` function isTokenValid(user) {     var timeLeft = !(                       // negation         !config                             // config object does not exist         || !user.token                      // user object does not have a token         || user.token.invalidated           // token is explicitly invalidated         || config.uninitialized             // config isn't initialized         || config.ignoreTimestamps          // ignore timestamps         || !getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry)  // > 0 if expiration is in the future     );     return timeLeft > 0 }  function getTimeLeft(expiry) {     return expiry - getSystemTime() } ```
