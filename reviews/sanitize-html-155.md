### Summary
*Cross Site Scripting*<br><br>Recommendation: Upgrade to version 1.2.3 or later.
### Details
sanitize-html is a library for scrubbing html input for malicious values Versions 1.2.2 and below have a cross site scripting vulnerability under certain scenarios:  Entering the following:  `<IMG SRC= onmouseover="alert('XSS');">` produces the following:  `<img src="onmouseover="alert('XSS');"" />` This is definitely invalid HTML, but would suggest that it's being interpreted incorrectly by the parser.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <=1.2.2
<br>• Patched Versions: >=1.2.3
