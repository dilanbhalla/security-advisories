### Summary
*Invalid input to route validation rules*<br><br>Recommendation: Upgrade to call 3.0.2.  hapi users should upgrade to 13.4.2.
### Details
call is an HTTP router that is primarily used by the hapi framework.  There exists a bug in call versions 2.0.1-3.0.1 that does not validate empty parameters, which could result in invalid input bypassing the route validation rules.  For example, in the routing scheme `/api/{param}/{param2}/details`, a request made to `/api///` would match incorrectly.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: >= 2.0.1 <3.0.2
<br>• Patched Versions: >=3.0.2
