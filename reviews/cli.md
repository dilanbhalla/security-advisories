### Summary
*Arbitrary File Write*<br><br>Update to version 1.0.0 or later
### Details
``` lock_file = '/tmp/' + cli.app + '.pid', log_file = '/tmp/' + cli.app + '.log'; ``` The package `node-cli` insecurely uses the lock_file and log_file. Both of these are temporary, but it allows the starting user to overwrite any file they have access to.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <1.0.0
<br>• Patched Versions: >=1.0.0
