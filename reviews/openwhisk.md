### Summary
*Remote Memory Exposure*<br><br>update openwhisk to 3.3.1 or higher
### Details
When a number is passed to `api_key`, affected versions of openwhisk allocate an uninitialized buffer and send that over network in Authorization header (base64-encoded). PoC: ```js var openwhisk = require('openwhisk'); var options = {apihost: '127.0.0.1:1433', api_key: 50}; var ow = openwhisk(options); ow.actions.invoke({actionName: 'sample'}).then(result => console.log(result)) ```  Reported at 2017-03-01
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <3.3.1
<br>• Patched Versions: >=3.3.1
