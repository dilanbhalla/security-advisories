### Summary
*Directory Traversal*<br><br>Upgrade to restafary version 1.6.1 or greater.
### Details
- restafary is a REpresentful State Transfer API for Creating, Reading, Using, Deleting files on a server from the web - restafary is able to set up a root path, which should only allow it to run inside of that root path it specified.  - An attacker is able to provide a specifically crafted path to access files outside of this specified root path.     - Note: this is only possible if the attacker has access to the restafary application.
