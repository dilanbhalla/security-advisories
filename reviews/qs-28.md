### Summary
*Denial-of-Service Extended Event Loop Blocking*<br><br>Update qs to version 1.0.0 or greater
### Details
The qs module does not have an option or default for specifying object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will block the event loop for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be processed while this blocking is occurring.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <1.0.0
<br>• Patched Versions: >= 1.x
