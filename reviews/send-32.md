### Summary
*Directory Traversal*<br><br>Recommendation: Upgrade to a version greater than or equal to 0.8.4.
### Details
When relying on the root option to restrict file access it may be possible for an application consumer to escape out of the restricted directory and access files in a similarly named directory. For example, `static(_dirname + '/public')` would allow access to `_dirname + '/public-restricted'`.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: < 0.8.4
<br>• Patched Versions: >= 0.8.4
