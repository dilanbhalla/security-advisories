### Summary
*Cross Site Scripting*<br><br>Upgrade to at least version 1.1
### Details
dojo is the core module for the Dojo Toolkit. The dojo package covers a wide range of functionality like AJAX, DOM manipulation, class-type programming, events, promises, data stores, drag-and-drop and internationalization libraries.  There is a bug in the `dijit.Editor` and `textarea` where input, even sanitized, executes javascript. This is because the `<textarea>` tag only sees the final, unsanitized, user input.
<br><br>• Affected Versions: <= 1.0
<br>• Patched Versions: >= 1.1
